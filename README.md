# NYC Citi Bike sharing
## Overview of Project
Analyze NYC City Bike ride sharing data to determine if a similar business at Des Moines, Iowa is a good investment.
### Purpose
Analyze the data and create digestable visualizations and dashboards that helps understand the ride sharing business; emphasis will be put in August since in the Summer months is more likely to be traffic.

## Results

## Summary

Overall the service is used by commuters and a push for increasing female ridership can be made. Two visualizations that will bring more insights to the analyzis are:

1. Breakdown users by gender and ages will help understand which user segment should be targeted for marketing campaigns
2. A histogram of number of bikes and total trip duration will allow to test hypothesis, such as what is the probability of a user riding a bike after it has been ridden 'X' amount of time
